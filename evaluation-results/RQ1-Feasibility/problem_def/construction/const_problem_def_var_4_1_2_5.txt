This scenario outlines a construction mission variant involving 4 task type(s), 1 robot(s), and 2 human worker(s), operating across 5 location(s). The plan is designed to coordinate human workers and autonomous robots to complete all task instances while meeting probability-of-success and resource constraints.

## Locations

- l1: "Room A" at coordinates (5, 5).
- l2: "Room B" at coordinates (1, 5).
- l3: "Room C" at coordinates (9, 5).
- l6: "Room F" at coordinates (1, 9).
- l10: "Room J" at coordinates (9, 1).

## Paths

For simplicity, all direct paths between connected locations have a uniform distance of 10. The site is connected via the following bidirectional paths:

- A path connects l2 to l1.
- A path connects l1 to l3.
- A path connects l2 to l6.

## Tasks

There are 4 type(s) of construction tasks required for this variant:

- t1: "Foundation preparation", with a base duration of 15.
    - t1_msa at l6.
    - t1_msb at l3.
- t2: "Electrical installation", with a base duration of 30.
    - t2_ip1 at l10.
    - t2_ip2 at l3.
- t3: "Plumbing installation", with a base duration of 45.
    - t3_bza at l3.
    - t3_bzb at l10.
- t4: "Finishing work", with a base duration of 20.
    - t4_se1 at l10.
    - t4_wcp1 at l1.

        - t3: probability 0.98, cost 10, duration 35, retries 1.
- Human h2: Starts at l1.
    - Capabilities:
        - t3: probability 0.98, cost 10, duration 35, retries 1.
        - t1: probability 0.957, cost 11, duration 35, retries 2.
        - t4: probability 0.96, cost 12, duration 29, retries 1.

## Constraints

The project plan requires a minimum overall probability of success of 0.95. Any individual task assignment within the plan must have a success probability of no less than 0.9.
