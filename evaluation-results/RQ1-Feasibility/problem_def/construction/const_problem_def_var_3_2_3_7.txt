This scenario outlines a construction mission variant involving 3 task type(s), 2 robot(s), and 3 human worker(s), operating across 7 location(s). The plan is designed to coordinate human workers and autonomous robots to complete all task instances while meeting probability-of-success and resource constraints.

## Locations

- l1: "Room A" at coordinates (5, 5).
- l2: "Room B" at coordinates (1, 5).
- l3: "Room C" at coordinates (9, 5).
- l5: "Room E" at coordinates (7, 1).
- l6: "Room F" at coordinates (1, 9).
- l7: "Room G" at coordinates (9, 9).
- l8: "Room H" at coordinates (5, 1).

## Paths

For simplicity, all direct paths between connected locations have a uniform distance of 10. The site is connected via the following bidirectional paths:

- A path connects l2 to l1.
- A path connects l1 to l3.
- A path connects l8 to l5.
- A path connects l2 to l6.
- A path connects l3 to l7.

## Tasks

There are 3 type(s) of construction tasks required for this variant:

- t2: "Electrical installation", with a base duration of 30.
    - t2_ip1 at l8.
    - t2_ip2 at l8.
- t3: "Plumbing installation", with a base duration of 45.
    - t3_bza at l3.
    - t3_bzb at l5.
- t4: "Finishing work", with a base duration of 20.
    - t4_se1 at l8.
    - t4_wcp1 at l3.
