This scenario outlines a construction mission variant involving 3 task type(s), 2 robot(s), and 1 human worker(s), operating across 6 location(s). The plan is designed to coordinate human workers and autonomous robots to complete all task instances while meeting probability-of-success and resource constraints.

## Locations

- l1: "Room A" at coordinates (5, 5).
- l3: "Room C" at coordinates (9, 5).
- l4: "Room D" at coordinates (3, 1).
- l5: "Room E" at coordinates (7, 1).
- l6: "Room F" at coordinates (1, 9).
- l7: "Room G" at coordinates (9, 9).

## Paths

For simplicity, all direct paths between connected locations have a uniform distance of 10. The site is connected via the following bidirectional paths:

- A path connects l1 to l3.
- A path connects l3 to l7.

## Tasks

There are 3 type(s) of construction tasks required for this variant:

- t1: "Foundation preparation", with a base duration of 15.
    - t1_msa at l6.
    - t1_msb at l7.
- t2: "Electrical installation", with a base duration of 30.
    - t2_ip1 at l4.
    - t2_ip2 at l6.
- t3: "Plumbing installation", with a base duration of 45.
    - t3_bza at l4.
    - t3_bzb at l5.

## Agents

The workforce in this variant consists of 2 autonomous robot(s) and 1 human worker(s).

- Robot r1: Starts at l1.
    - Capabilities:
        - t1: probability 0.99, cost 2, duration 12, retries 4.
        - t3: probability 0.95, cost 5, duration 40, retries 2.
- Robot r3: Starts at l3.
    - Capabilities:
        - t1: probability 0.967, cost 6, duration 40, retries 1.
- Human h1: Starts at l4.
    - Capabilities:
        - t2: probability 0.97, cost 8, duration 25, retries 2.
        - t3: probability 0.98, cost 10, duration 35, retries 1.

## Constraints

The project plan requires a minimum overall probability of success of 0.95. Any individual task assignment within the plan must have a success probability of no less than 0.9.
