This scenario outlines a construction mission variant involving 4 task type(s), 3 robot(s), and 1 human worker(s), operating across 9 location(s). The plan is designed to coordinate human workers and autonomous robots to complete all task instances while meeting probability-of-success and resource constraints.

## Locations

- l1: "Room A" at coordinates (5, 5).
- l2: "Room B" at coordinates (1, 5).
- l3: "Room C" at coordinates (9, 5).
- l4: "Room D" at coordinates (3, 1).
- l5: "Room E" at coordinates (7, 1).
- l6: "Room F" at coordinates (1, 9).
- l7: "Room G" at coordinates (9, 9).
- l8: "Room H" at coordinates (5, 1).
- l9: "Room I" at coordinates (5, 9).

## Paths

For simplicity, all direct paths between connected locations have a uniform distance of 10. The site is connected via the following bidirectional paths:

- A path connects l2 to l1.
- A path connects l1 to l3.
- A path connects l4 to l8.
- A path connects l8 to l5.
- A path connects l6 to l9.
- A path connects l9 to l7.
- A path connects l2 to l6.
- A path connects l1 to l9.
- A path connects l8 to l9.
- A path connects l3 to l7.
