This is an Agricultural Robotics case study describing a planning problem within a grid-based environment involving multiple agents and tasks.

## **Locations**

The environment uses 5 location(s) from a 3x3 grid:

* **l1**: The 'Initial location' at coordinates (1, 1).
* **l2**: The 'Location to the right of location' at coordinates (1, 2).
* **l3**: A location at coordinates (1, 3).
* **l4**: A location at coordinates (2, 1).
* **l5**: A location at coordinates (2, 2).

## **Paths**

The following bidirectional paths exist (distance = 1):
* A path of distance 1 connects l1 and l2.
* A path of distance 1 connects l1 and l4.
* A path of distance 1 connects l2 and l3.
* A path of distance 1 connects l2 and l5.
* A path of distance 1 connects l4 and l5.

## **Tasks**

* **Harvesting (t1)**: Grape harvesting is an extremely arduous and repetitive activity. This task has a base duration of 1. Instances: t1l4 at l4, t1l5 at l5, t1l1 at l1.
* **Vineyard monitoring (t2)**: Continuous monitoring of vine health and conditions. This task has a base duration of 1. Instances: t2l4 at l4, t2l5 at l5, t2l1 at l1.
* **Grapevine identification (t3)**: Taking leaf pictures and sending to a central unit. This task has a base duration of 1. Instances: t3l4 at l4, t3l5 at l5, t3l1 at l1.
* **Soil moisture mapping (t4)**: Survey soil moisture levels across plots. This task has a base duration of 1. Instances: t4l4 at l4, t4l5 at l5, t4l1 at l1.

## **Agents**

A team of 1 human worker(s) and 3 robot(s) is available. All agents start at l1.
Workers can perform t1 (prob=1.00, cost=3, duration=5, retries=5) and t3 (prob=0.99, cost=5, duration=3, retries=5).
Robots can perform t2 (prob=0.99, cost=1, duration=5, retries=10) and t3 (prob=0.97, cost=1, duration=3, retries=10).
For extended tasks, workers can also do t4 (prob=0.98, cost=2, duration=4, retries=5), and robots can do t4 (prob=0.97, cost=1, duration=5, retries=10).

## **Constraints**

* The minimum acceptable probability of success for the entire mission is 0.95.
* Any single task assignment must have a minimum success probability of 0.5 to be considered valid.
